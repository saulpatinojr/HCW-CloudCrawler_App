"""Every workflow job that runs Node.js or Python chooses its version (saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks#1707).

A job that runs `node`, `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `python3`, `pip`, `pipx`, `pytest`, `uv` or `uvx` without
actions/setup-node or actions/setup-python gets whatever the runner image ships: on ubuntu-26.04 that was Node.js 24
and Python 3.14 in November 2026, both below the program's floors (Node.js 26, Python 3.15). Nothing else notices,
because a job that names no version has nothing to read. `uv` and `uvx` count as Python, because uv runs the
interpreter it finds, the runner's own unless one was set up; so astral-sh/setup-uv counts as setting Python up only
when it is given a `python-version` at or above the floor. `yarn` and `pnpm` are Node.js programs and count as Node.js;
`pytest` and `pipx` are Python programs and count as Python. pipx builds each tool's virtual environment from
`PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON` or, when that is unset, from the interpreter pipx itself runs on
(https://github.com/pypa/pipx/blob/main/src/pipx/interpreter.py, `get_default_python`). GitHub's Ubuntu runner images
install pipx with the image's own python3 (`python3 -m pip install pipx`, actions/runner-images#14654), so after
actions/setup-python a `pipx` step still uses the image's Python unless it is given `--python` (actions/setup-python's
`python-path` output) or `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON`. So a step that runs `pipx` in command position must also choose its
interpreter: `--python` among that pipx command's own words (`pipx run --python "$PYTHON_PATH" ...`), or
`PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON` set in front of it (`PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p pipx ...`) or in the step's, job's or workflow's
`env:` (Copilot on HCW-NetworkEyes_App#393). A step that does not is reported, named; one kept that way on purpose is
listed, with its reason, in PIPX_ALLOWED. An `export PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=...` earlier in the script is not read; use
`env:` instead.

A command counts when it is in command position on a line of a `run:` step: at the start, after `$(`, `<(`, a backtick,
`(`, `{`, `|`, `&` or `;`, after a `case` pattern at the start of a line (`check)`), after leading `NAME=value`
assignments (the value plain text, a quoted string, or both run together), or after a word that runs the next one
(`env`, `sudo`, `xargs`, `exec`, `time`, `nice`, `nohup`, `stdbuf`, `timeout` with its duration, `command -p`, `!`,
`if`, `then`, `do` and the like) and that word's options (`sudo -u nobody`, `env -i`, `stdbuf -oL`, a `--` that ends
them). It counts with a path in front too (`/usr/bin/python3`, `./venv/bin/python`), because a path to the runner's
interpreter is still the runner's, and `python3.15.2` counts like `python3`. It does not count in a comment, a
heredoc's body, a quoted string (unless a double-quoted string runs a command with `$(`, `<(` or a backtick; a
single-quoted one may run over several lines, as a `docker run image bash -c '...'` script does) or as an argument
(`docker run image python ...`, `command -v node`, `sudo -u node whoami`, or the first word of a line that continues
the one before it). One more quoted string is read: the script of a shell that is itself in command position and
given `-c` (`bash -c 'node x'`, `sh -euo pipefail -c "..."`, `sudo bash -lc '...'`, `bash -c -- '...'`). That script
runs on the runner, so its commands count, while the same words after `docker run image` stay a container's; an
unquoted script is the one word after `-c` (`bash -c node x.js` runs `node`, while `bash -c echo node` does not). A
double-quoted `-c` script is read both ways: as the outer shell reads it (its `$(...)` and backticks run first) and as
the inner shell does. The set-up step must come before the first such step. Limits, on purpose: a job that runs in a
`container:` uses that image's runtime and is not checked; a script a step calls (`bash scripts/ci/x.sh`) is not read,
so a step whose script starts a runtime is listed in INDIRECT_RUNTIME (as HCW-CloudAssessor_App's and
HCW-CloudCrawler_App's copies do). A command substitution inside a double-quoted string (`"$(...)"`, or a backtick
pair) runs on the runner, so it is read like any other script, a `-c` script in it included (`echo "$(bash -c 'node
x')"`); one that hands its script to a container (`"$(docker run img bash -c '...')"`) stays unread.

A set-up step with its own `if:` may be skipped while a later command still runs on the runner's own interpreter
(Copilot on HCW-NetworkEyes_AddOn#100), so it covers a later step only when that step's `if:` makes the set-up's true:
the same condition, one of the terms the set-up's condition joins with a top-level `||`, or a condition that joins one
of those with a top-level `&&` and has no top-level `||` of its own (a step under `a && b` runs only when `a` holds, so
a set-up step under `a || c` has run; Copilot on HCW-HybridCloudWorks#1716; but `a && b || d` can run through `d`
alone, so it is not split; Copilot on HCW-NetworkEyes_App#393). Conditions are compared without a surrounding
`${{ }}`, with runs of spaces made one, and a term without one pair of parentheses around the whole of it. Equal
text means equal value only
for values that stay fixed during a job (`matrix`, `github`, `inputs`, `needs`, `vars`, `secrets`); a term that reads
anything else (`env.*`, which a step can change through `$GITHUB_ENV`, `steps.*`, `job`, `runner`, `hashFiles()`) is
never matched by its text, so its step is reported (Copilot on HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#74). The one exception is
`steps.<id>` of a step that comes before the set-up step: its outputs, outcome and conclusion are fixed once it has
run (the `core-update.yml` jobs' `steps.refs.outputs.changed`). Prefer the fixed values in such conditions. A set-up
step with no `if:` covers every later step whose condition does not test the job's status. A job's own `if:` does
not matter here, because it decides whether every step of the job runs, alike.

The job's status is compared on its own. Without `always()`, `failure()`, `cancelled()` or `success()` in it, a step's
condition includes an unwritten `success()`, so a set-up step with no `if:` is skipped once an earlier step has
failed, while a later `if: always()`, `failure()` or `!cancelled()` step still runs (Copilot on
HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#72). So after each job status (success, a failure, a cancel) a later step may run after,
its set-up step must surely run, or depend on the same thing by the rule above, applied to the conditions with their
status-only `&&` terms taken out, but only from a condition with no top-level `||`: `failure() && a || b` is
`(failure() && a) || b`, so taking `failure()` out would change it (Copilot on HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#74).
`||`, `&&`, `!` and parentheses are followed: `always() && !cancelled()` runs after
success and failure, not after a cancel.

Each set-up step must also ask for the floor or newer (Copilot on HCW-CloudCrawler_App#81): `python-version` or
`python-version-file`, `node-version` or `node-version-file`, read through `${{ env.X }}` (the step's, job's or
workflow's `env:`), `${{ matrix.X }}` (every entry of the job's matrix list) and the named file. A version that names a
line only (`26`, `26.x`, `3.15`) stands for that line's newest release, so it passes when the line is at or above the
floor's; an exact version (`26.10.0`) must be at or above the floor itself; anything else (`26.11.0-rc.1`,
`26.11.0.0`, `lts/*`) cannot be compared. A value this test cannot work out fails it, naming
the step, rather than passing unchecked. A set-up step kept below the floor on purpose is listed, with its reason, in
BELOW_FLOOR_ALLOWED.

This is a copy of the check. Its canonical twin is the website's scripts/workflow-runtime-setup.test.mjs in
HCW-HybridCloudWorks; this file is taken from the Python copy in HCW-NetworkEyes_App
(tests/security/test_workflow_runtime_setup.py), which the other HCW Python repositories copy too. The command reading
(`_shell_text`, `runs_runtime`, the patterns above it) and the condition rules (`covers`) behave the same as the
website's; only the lists below, which name this repository's workflows, are this repository's own. Keep the logic the
same in each copy and change it in all of them together.

The workflows are read with a small line reader rather than a YAML library, because none is a dependency here. It
relies on the layout every workflow in this repository has (a `jobs:` key at the top level, a `steps:` list, block
`run: |` scripts, `with:` and `env:` written `{ ... }` or as indented `key: value` lines); a file it cannot read that
way fails the test rather than being skipped.
