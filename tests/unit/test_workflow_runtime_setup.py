"""Every workflow job that runs Node.js or Python chooses its version (saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks#1707).

A job that runs `node`, `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `python3`, `pip`, `pipx`, `pytest`, `uv` or `uvx` without
actions/setup-node or actions/setup-python gets whatever the runner image ships: on ubuntu-26.04 that was Node.js 24 and
Python 3.14 in November 2026, both below the program's floors (Node.js 26, Python 3.15). Nothing else notices, because a
job that names no version has nothing to read. `uv` and `uvx` count as Python, because uv runs the interpreter it finds,
the runner's own unless one was set up; so astral-sh/setup-uv counts as setting Python up only when it is given a
`python-version` at or above the floor. `yarn` and `pnpm` are Node.js programs and count as Node.js; `pytest` and `pipx`
are Python programs and count as Python. pipx builds each tool's virtual environment from `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON` or, when
that is unset, from the interpreter pipx itself runs on (https://github.com/pypa/pipx/blob/main/src/pipx/interpreter.py,
`get_default_python`). GitHub's Ubuntu runner images install pipx with the image's own python3 (`python3 -m pip install
pipx`, actions/runner-images#14654), so after actions/setup-python a `pipx` step still uses the image's Python unless it
is given `--python` (actions/setup-python's `python-path` output) or `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON`. So a step that runs `pipx`
in command position must also choose its interpreter: `--python` among that pipx command's own words (`pipx run --python
"$PYTHON_PATH" ...`), or `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON` set in front of it (`PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p pipx ...`) or in the step's,
job's or workflow's `env:` (Copilot on HCW-NetworkEyes_App#393). A step that does not is reported, named; one kept that
way on purpose is listed, with its reason, in PIPX_ALLOWED. The script's own `unset`, `export` and assignments of it are
read too, the last in a shell winning.

What pipx is given must also be the set-up Python. The runner's own Python named by its path (`--python
/usr/bin/python3`, `/usr/bin/python3.12`, `/bin/python3` or the Azure CLI's `/opt/az/bin/python3`, the same as
`PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON`) chooses nothing, nor does a command or process substitution this test cannot run (`"$(command
-v python3)"`, `<(...)`) or a `$` the shell passes on as text (`'$P'`, `\\$P`). A
`${{ steps.<id>.outputs.python-path }}` value (only that output: `cache-hit` and `python-version` are not a path) counts
only when `<id>` is an earlier
actions/setup-python step of the same job that
is sure to have run first, by the same rules as a set-up step with an `if:` (below); a missing id, a later step, a step
that is not actions/setup-python or one that may be skipped chooses nothing, and so does a `steps` reference written
another way (`steps['py'].outputs`), which names no id this test can read. A shell variable in the value (`--python
"$PYTHON_PATH"`) is read from the step's, job's or workflow's `env:`; one the script sets itself (`P=...`, `for P in`,
`read P`, but not `echo P=...` or `P=/x pipx ...`) counts for the commands after it in the same shell, as does
`$pythonLocation` (setup-python sets it) once an actions/setup-python step, with or without an id, is sure to have
run first, and any other one chooses nothing. A name set in a `-c` script, a shell fed a
heredoc, a `$(...)` or a `( ... )` subshell stays there, and one set outside reaches a child shell only when exported.
A later assignment in the script wins over the `env:` value, and its value is read by the same rules
(`P=/usr/bin/python3` chooses nothing). A bare
`python3.15` still counts, and so does a path under `${{ env.pythonLocation }}`, by the same rule as
`$pythonLocation`. Any other GitHub expression chooses nothing (`${{ github.workspace }}/.venv/bin/python`,
`${{ inputs.python }}`, `${{ env.UNSET }}`), except `${{ env.X }}` and `${{ matrix.X }}`, which are read as GitHub
replaces them, from the step's, job's or workflow's `env:` and from every entry of the job's matrix list, so they
choose when the value they stand for does (Copilot on HCW-NetworkEyes_AddOn#109). A path is read as the shell
resolves it before it is compared, so `/usr/bin/../bin/python3` and `/usr/./bin/python3` are the runner's own
(Copilot on HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#75). Settings travel the way the shell passes them: `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p
bash -c 'pipx run x'` and `env PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p env -S 'pipx run x'` give the inner script the setting, and `sudo`
drops
every inherited setting (its default `env_reset`) unless it is given `-E` or `--preserve-env` (bare, or with a list
that names the variable), while `sudo PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p pipx ...` sets it.

A command counts when it is in command position on a line of a `run:` step: at the start, after `$(`, `<(`, a backtick,
`(`, `{`, `|`, `&` or `;`, after a `case` pattern at the start of a line (`check)`), after leading `NAME=value`
assignments (the value plain text, a quoted string, or both run together), or after a word that runs the next one
(`env`, `sudo`, `xargs`, `exec`, `time`, `nice`, `nohup`, `stdbuf`, `timeout` with its duration, `command -p`, `!`,
`if`, `then`, `do` and the like) and that word's options (`sudo -u nobody`, `env -i`, `stdbuf -oL`, a `--` that ends
them). A wrapper's long option may be shortened as far as it stays unambiguous, as the commands themselves accept
(`timeout --kill=5`, `nice --adj 5`); an ambiguous one is read as taking no value. A long or short option that takes a
value takes the next word even when it starts with `-` (`timeout --kill-after -5`, `nice -n -5`). It counts with a
path in front too (`/usr/bin/python3`, `./venv/bin/python`, `/usr/bin/env node`), because a path to the runner's
interpreter is still the runner's, and `python3.15.2` counts like `python3`. A `$'...'` string is decoded as the shell
decodes it (`\\xHH`, `\\uHHHH`, `\\UHHHHHHHH`, octal `\\NNN`, `\\n` and the like) and read as one word, so
`$'\\x70ython3'` is `python3` while `$'node\\x20x'` is the one word `node x`. A heredoc's body is read only for the
commands the shell runs in it: `$(...)` and backticks in the body of a heredoc whose delimiter is not quoted or escaped
(`<<EOF`, `<<-EOF`), and nothing in the body of `<<'EOF'`, `<<"EOF"` or `<<\\EOF`. It does not count in a comment,
the rest of a heredoc's body, a quoted string (unless a double-quoted string runs a command with `$(`, `<(` or a
backtick; a single-quoted one may run over several lines, as a `docker run image bash -c '...'` script does) or as an
argument
(`docker run image python ...`, `command -v node`, `sudo -u node whoami`, or the first word of a line that continues
the one before it). One more quoted string is read: the script of a shell that is itself in command position and
given `-c` (`bash -c 'node x'`, `sh -euo pipefail -c "..."`, `sudo bash -lc '...'`, `bash -c -- '...'`). That script
runs on the runner, so its commands count, while the same words after `docker run image` stay a container's; an
unquoted script is the one word after `-c` (`bash -c node x.js` runs `node`, while `bash -c echo node` does not), and
text written onto the `-c` is read as the script too (`bash -cnode x`, `bash -ec'node x'`), though bash and dash
refuse that form, so reading it only errs towards reporting. A double-quoted `-c` script is read both ways: as the outer
shell reads it (its `$(...)` and backticks run first) and as the inner shell does. The set-up step must come before the
first such step. Limits, on purpose: a job that runs in a
`container:` uses that image's runtime and is not checked; a script a step calls (`bash scripts/ci/x.sh`) is not read,
so a step whose script starts a runtime is listed in INDIRECT_RUNTIME (as HCW-CloudAssessor_App's and
HCW-CloudCrawler_App's copies do). A command substitution inside a double-quoted string (`"$(...)"`, or a backtick
pair) runs on the runner, so it is read like any other script, a `-c` script in it included (`echo "$(bash -c 'node
x')"`); one that hands its script to a container (`"$(docker run img bash -c '...')"`) stays unread. A heredoc or a
here-string given to a shell that reads its script from its input is that shell's script (`bash <<'EOF'`, `bash -s
<<EOF`, `bash <<< 'node x'`), whatever the quoting of the delimiter, since the shell runs it; the same body given to
`cat` is text.

Round 3 (saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks#1707) reads more forms the way the shell and GitHub do. A command named in
quotes (`'node' x.js`, `"node" x.js`, `''node x`) or with a `\\` in it (`\\node x`) is that command, a command's name
ends at an operator as well as a space (`node;`, `x=$(node)`), and `eval` and `builtin` run the words after them. A
quoted `"NAME=..."` given to `env` or `sudo` is an assignment, as env and sudo read it. A runtime run through `sudo`
counts as the runner's own even after a set-up step, because sudo looks its command up on its own fixed list of folders
(`secure_path`); only `sudo env "PATH=$PATH" ...`, which passes the PATH the shell already has, keeps the set-up one,
and a step whose `shell:` runs through sudo runs its whole text that way. A step whose `shell:` (or
`defaults.run.shell`) is a runtime (`python`, `node {0}`) runs it. The outer shell runs only the `$(...)` and backticks
of a double-quoted string, so `bash -c "x; pipx run y $(true)"` runs no `pipx` outside. `unset`, `export -n` (which
takes a name's export away) and `declare +x` are read, and so is a script line that sets PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON to a value
that chooses nothing (and, since Copilot's third review, one that chooses, the latest change in a shell winning). sudo
refuses `-i` together with `-E` outright, so `sudo -iE pipx` counts as having no Python chosen. A value given to pipx
chooses nothing when it is a bare name other than the floor's own `python3.15` (PATH would find the runner's), a path
under /usr/local/bin, a path with a `..` after a part this check cannot see, or a pattern or `~` the shell would still
expand; a `\\` in it is dropped first. `${{ env.X }}` is read as GitHub evaluates it, level by level, and `${{
env.pythonLocation }}` stays setup-python's word, which chooses nothing when an `env:` sets `pythonLocation` itself or
the script unsets it.

Limits, known and kept: a composite action whose set-up step takes its version from `${{ inputs.* }}` cannot be read, so
it fails closed and needs an entry in BELOW_FLOOR_ALLOWED; a `shell: python` step's text is still read as shell too, and
an `eval` script is read as a child shell (a name set but not exported before it is not seen), both of which can only
add findings; and these are not reported: `env -i python3` after a set-up step (env empties PATH, so `python3` is looked
up on the system's default folders); a `--python` path to a Python outside the folders of RUNNER_PYTHON_FOLDERS
(`/opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.12...`, `/usr/share/miniconda/bin/python3`); a relative path after `cd` (`cd /usr/bin &&
pipx run --python ./python3 x`); a value a `for` loop or `read` sets (`for P in /usr/bin/python3; do ...`), which counts
as chosen; a PATH or setting written to `$GITHUB_PATH` or `$GITHUB_ENV` by an earlier step; and a set-up version `3` or
`3.x` (a major line only), which reads as at the floor. `unset -n P` is read as unsetting P, which is what bash does
unless P is a name reference.

A composite action (`.github/actions/<name>/action.yml`, `runs: using: composite`) is checked like a job of its own,
named `composite`, so its keys read `.github/actions/<name>/action.yml > composite > step name > runtime`. Its steps
run inside the caller's job, but a caller cannot be relied on to have set the runtime up, so the action sets up what it
runs itself. Its findings go into the same lists as a workflow's, and an exception for one goes in the same lists too.

A set-up step with its own `if:` may be skipped while a later command still runs on the runner's own interpreter
(Copilot on HCW-NetworkEyes_AddOn#100), so it covers a later step only when that step's `if:` makes the set-up's true:
the same condition, one of the terms the set-up's condition joins with a top-level `||`, or a condition that joins one
of those with a top-level `&&` and has no top-level `||` of its own (a step under `a && b` runs only when `a` holds, so
a set-up step under `a || c` has run; Copilot on HCW-HybridCloudWorks#1716; but `a && b || d` can run through `d`
alone, so it is not split; Copilot on HCW-NetworkEyes_App#393), or, when the set-up's condition has no top-level
`||`, a condition with no top-level `||` whose `&&` terms include every one of the set-up's (`a && b` covers
`c && a && b`; Copilot on HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App#117), an `&&` term of the set-up's that joins terms with `||`
counting as included when one of those terms is (`(a || b) && c` covers `a && c`, not `d && c`; Copilot on
HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App#118). Conditions are compared without a surrounding `${{ }}`, with runs of
spaces made one, and a term without one pair of parentheses around the whole of it. Equal text means equal value only
for values that stay fixed during a job (`matrix`, `github`, `inputs`, `needs`, `vars`, `secrets`); a term that reads
anything else (`env.*`, which a step can change through `$GITHUB_ENV`, `steps.*`, `job`, `runner`, `hashFiles()`) is
never matched by its text, so its step is reported (Copilot on HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#74). The one exception is
`steps.<id>` of a step that comes before the set-up step: its outputs, outcome and conclusion are fixed once it has
run (the `core-update.yml` jobs' `steps.refs.outputs.changed`). Prefer the fixed values in such conditions. A set-up
step with no `if:` covers every later step whose condition does not test the job's status. A job's own `if:` does
not matter here, because it decides whether every step of the job runs, alike.

The job's status is compared on its own. Without `always()`, `failure()`, `cancelled()` or `success()` in it, a step's
condition includes an unwritten `success()`, so a set-up step with no `if:` is skipped once an earlier step has
failed, while a later `if: always()`, `failure()` or `!cancelled()` step still runs (Copilot on
HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#72). So after each job status (success, a failure, a cancel) a later step may run after,
its set-up step must surely run, or depend on the same thing by the rule above, applied to the conditions with their
status-only `&&` terms taken out, but only from a condition with no top-level `||`: `failure() && a || b` is
`(failure() && a) || b`, so taking `failure()` out would change it (Copilot on HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#74).
`||`, `&&`, `!` and parentheses are followed: `always() && !cancelled()` runs after
success and failure, not after a cancel.

Each set-up step (a composite action's too, which must have `runs: steps:`) must also ask for the floor or newer
(Copilot on HCW-CloudCrawler_App#81): `python-version` or `python-version-file`, `node-version` or `node-version-file`,
read through `${{ env.X }}` (the step's, job's or workflow's `env:`), `${{ matrix.X }}` (every entry of the job's matrix
list) and the named file, read only when it is a `.python-version`, `.nvmrc` or `.node-version` file at a relative path
inside the checkout with no `..` and no symbolic link on the way. A version that names a line only (`26`, `26.x`,
`3.15`) stands for that line's newest release, so it passes when the line is at or above the floor's; an exact version
(`26.10.0`) must be at or above the floor itself; anything else (`26.11.0-rc.1`, `26.11.0.0`, `lts/*`) cannot be
compared. A value this test cannot work out fails it, naming the step, rather than passing unchecked. A set-up step kept
below the floor on purpose is listed, with its reason, in BELOW_FLOOR_ALLOWED.

This is a copy of the check. Its canonical twin is the Python copy in HCW-NetworkEyes_App
(tests/security/test_workflow_runtime_setup.py), which the other HCW Python repositories copy too; its JavaScript twin
is the website's scripts/workflow-runtime-setup.test.mjs in HCW-HybridCloudWorks. The command reading (`_shell_text`,
`runs_runtime`, the patterns above it) and the condition rules (`covers`) behave the same as both; only the lists
below, which name this repository's workflows, are this repository's own. Keep the logic the same in each copy and
change it in all of them together.

The workflows are read with a small line reader rather than a YAML library, because none is a dependency here. It
relies on the layout every workflow in this repository has (a `jobs:` key at the top level, a `steps:` list, block
`run: |` scripts, `with:` and `env:` written `{ ... }` or as indented `key: value` lines); a file it cannot read that
way fails the test rather than being skipped. A `steps:` written on one line (`steps: [{run: ...}]`) or a step written
as one (`- {run: ...}`) is such a file: the reader stops with an error rather than read the job as having no steps. A
value YAML reads its own way is read that way: null (`~`, `null`, nothing) is empty, a block scalar (`|`, `>-`,
`|2-`, `>-2`) is its text, ending at the first line indented less than its content, a folded one (`run: >-`) folded as
YAML folds it, a double-quoted value with its escapes decoded, a single-quoted one with `''` read as `'`, a comment
after a value dropped (a matrix entry's too), and a plain number in its shortest form (`3.10` is `3.1`, as GitHub hands
it to an action); and a heredoc's delimiter is its whole word (`<<EOF-1`, `<<E"OF"`), its body ending only at a line
that is exactly that word (after leading tabs for `<<-`). `strategy:` or `matrix:` written on one line, a value that
runs over several lines or starts on the line after its key, a quoted key, a space before a key's colon, an anchor,
alias or tag (`&a`, `*a`, `!!str`) and any other line the reader cannot place stop the test too, as the website's
reader stops on them (round 3). A step's keys may follow `-` and any number of spaces, and a matrix list may start at
its key's own indent, as YAML allows.
