"""Every workflow job that runs Node.js or Python chooses its version (saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks#1707).

A job that runs `node`, `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `python3`, `pip`, `pipx`, `pytest`, `uv` or `uvx` without
actions/setup-node or actions/setup-python gets whatever the runner image ships: on ubuntu-26.04 that was Node.js 24
and Python 3.14 in November 2026, both below the program's floors (Node.js 26, Python 3.15). Nothing else notices,
because a job that names no version has nothing to read. `uv` and `uvx` count as Python, because uv runs the
interpreter it finds, the runner's own unless one was set up; so astral-sh/setup-uv counts as setting Python up only
when it is given a `python-version` at or above the floor. `yarn` and `pnpm` are Node.js programs and count as Node.js;
`pytest` and `pipx` are Python programs and count as Python. pipx builds each tool's virtual environment from
`PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON` or, when that is unset, from the interpreter pipx itself runs on
(https://github.com/pypa/pipx/blob/main/src/pipx/interpreter.py, `get_default_python`). GitHub's Ubuntu runner images
install pipx with the image's own python3 (`python3 -m pip install pipx`, actions/runner-images#14654), so after
actions/setup-python a `pipx` step still uses the image's Python unless it is given `--python` (actions/setup-python's
`python-path` output) or `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON`. So a step that runs `pipx` in command position must also choose its
interpreter: `--python` among that pipx command's own words (`pipx run --python "$PYTHON_PATH" ...`), or
`PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON` set in front of it (`PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p pipx ...`) or in the step's, job's or workflow's
`env:` (Copilot on HCW-NetworkEyes_App#393). A step that does not is reported, named; one kept that way on purpose is
listed, with its reason, in PIPX_ALLOWED. An `export PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=...` earlier in the script is not read; use
`env:` instead.

What pipx is given must also be the set-up Python. The runner's own Python named by its path (`--python
/usr/bin/python3`, `/usr/bin/python3.12`, `/bin/python3` or the Azure CLI's `/opt/az/bin/python3`, the same as
`PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON`) chooses nothing, nor does a command or process substitution this test cannot run (`"$(command
-v python3)"`, `<(...)`) or a `$` the shell passes on as text (`'$P'`, `\\$P`). A
`${{ steps.<id>.outputs.python-path }}` value (only that output: `cache-hit` and `python-version` are not a path) counts
only when `<id>` is an earlier
actions/setup-python step of the same job that
is sure to have run first, by the same rules as a set-up step with an `if:` (below); a missing id, a later step, a step
that is not actions/setup-python or one that may be skipped chooses nothing, and so does a `steps` reference written
another way (`steps['py'].outputs`), which names no id this test can read. A shell variable in the value (`--python
"$PYTHON_PATH"`) is read from the step's, job's or workflow's `env:`; one the script sets itself (`P=...`, `for P in`,
`read P`, but not `echo P=...` or `P=/x pipx ...`) counts for the commands after it in the same shell, as does
`$pythonLocation` (setup-python sets it) once an actions/setup-python step, with or without an id, is sure to have
run first, and any other one chooses nothing. A name set in a `-c` script, a shell fed a
heredoc, a `$(...)` or a `( ... )` subshell stays there, and one set outside reaches a child shell only when exported.
A later assignment in the script wins over the `env:` value, and its value is read by the same rules
(`P=/usr/bin/python3` chooses nothing). A bare
`python3.15` still counts, and so does a path under `${{ env.pythonLocation }}`, by the same rule as
`$pythonLocation`. Any other GitHub expression chooses nothing (`${{ github.workspace }}/.venv/bin/python`,
`${{ inputs.python }}`, `${{ env.UNSET }}`), except `${{ env.X }}` and `${{ matrix.X }}`, which are read as GitHub
replaces them, from the step's, job's or workflow's `env:` and from every entry of the job's matrix list, so they
choose when the value they stand for does (Copilot on HCW-NetworkEyes_AddOn#109). A path is read as the shell
resolves it before it is compared, so `/usr/bin/../bin/python3` and `/usr/./bin/python3` are the runner's own
(Copilot on HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#75). Settings travel the way the shell passes them: `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p
bash -c 'pipx run x'` and `env PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p env -S 'pipx run x'` give the inner script the setting, and `sudo`
drops
every inherited setting (its default `env_reset`) unless it is given `-E` or `--preserve-env` (bare, or with a list
that names the variable), while `sudo PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p pipx ...` sets it.

A command counts when it is in command position on a line of a `run:` step: at the start, after `$(`, `<(`, a backtick,
`(`, `{`, `|`, `&` or `;`, after a `case` pattern at the start of a line (`check)`), after leading `NAME=value`
assignments (the value plain text, a quoted string, or both run together), or after a word that runs the next one
(`env`, `sudo`, `xargs`, `exec`, `time`, `nice`, `nohup`, `stdbuf`, `timeout` with its duration, `command -p`, `!`,
`if`, `then`, `do` and the like) and that word's options (`sudo -u nobody`, `env -i`, `stdbuf -oL`, a `--` that ends
them). A wrapper's long option may be shortened as far as it stays unambiguous, as the commands themselves accept
(`timeout --kill=5`, `nice --adj 5`); an ambiguous one is read as taking no value. A long or short option that takes a
value takes the next word even when it starts with `-` (`timeout --kill-after -5`, `nice -n -5`). It counts with a
path in front too (`/usr/bin/python3`, `./venv/bin/python`, `/usr/bin/env node`), because a path to the runner's
interpreter is still the runner's, and `python3.15.2` counts like `python3`. A `$'...'` string is decoded as the shell
decodes it (`\\xHH`, `\\uHHHH`, `\\UHHHHHHHH`, octal `\\NNN`, `\\n` and the like) and read as one word, so
`$'\\x70ython3'` is `python3` while `$'node\\x20x'` is the one word `node x`. A heredoc's body is read only for the
commands the shell runs in it: `$(...)` and backticks in the body of a heredoc whose delimiter is not quoted or escaped
(`<<EOF`, `<<-EOF`), and nothing in the body of `<<'EOF'`, `<<"EOF"` or `<<\\EOF`. It does not count in a comment,
the rest of a heredoc's body, a quoted string (unless a double-quoted string runs a command with `$(`, `<(` or a
backtick; a single-quoted one may run over several lines, as a `docker run image bash -c '...'` script does) or as an
argument
(`docker run image python ...`, `command -v node`, `sudo -u node whoami`, or the first word of a line that continues
the one before it). One more quoted string is read: the script of a shell that is itself in command position and
given `-c` (`bash -c 'node x'`, `sh -euo pipefail -c "..."`, `sudo bash -lc '...'`, `bash -c -- '...'`). That script
runs on the runner, so its commands count, while the same words after `docker run image` stay a container's; an
unquoted script is the one word after `-c` (`bash -c node x.js` runs `node`, while `bash -c echo node` does not), and
text written onto the `-c` is read as the script too (`bash -cnode x`, `bash -ec'node x'`), though bash and dash
refuse that form, so reading it only errs towards reporting. A double-quoted `-c` script is read both ways: as the outer
shell reads it (its `$(...)` and backticks run first) and as the inner shell does. The set-up step must come before the
first such step. Limits, on purpose: a job that runs in a
`container:` uses that image's runtime and is not checked; a script a step calls (`bash scripts/ci/x.sh`) is not read,
so a step whose script starts a runtime is listed in INDIRECT_RUNTIME (as HCW-CloudAssessor_App's and
HCW-CloudCrawler_App's copies do). A command substitution inside a double-quoted string (`"$(...)"`, or a backtick
pair) runs on the runner, so it is read like any other script, a `-c` script in it included (`echo "$(bash -c 'node
x')"`); one that hands its script to a container (`"$(docker run img bash -c '...')"`) stays unread. A heredoc or a
here-string given to a shell that reads its script from its input is that shell's script (`bash <<'EOF'`, `bash -s
<<EOF`, `bash <<< 'node x'`), whatever the quoting of the delimiter, since the shell runs it; the same body given to
`cat` is text.

More limits, known and kept: a command named in quotes (`'node' x.js`, `"node" x.js`) is not read as that command
(only a `$'...'` one is); `sudo python3` after a set-up step counts as covered, though sudo's `secure_path` makes it run
the runner's own Python unless PATH is passed on (`sudo env "PATH=$PATH" ...`); a step with `shell: python` (or `node`)
runs its `run:` text with that runtime and is not read; a double-quoted `-c` script with a substitution in it is also
read as the outer shell reads it, which can report a `pipx` that the inner shell, given the outer settings, runs
correctly (`PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p bash -c "x; pipx run y $(true)"`); `unset PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON` and `export` earlier
in the script are not read; and a composite action whose set-up step takes its version from `${{ inputs.* }}` cannot
be read, so it fails the floor test and needs an entry in BELOW_FLOOR_ALLOWED.

A composite action (`.github/actions/<name>/action.yml`, `runs: using: composite`) is checked like a job of its own,
named `composite`, so its keys read `.github/actions/<name>/action.yml > composite > step name > runtime`. Its steps
run inside the caller's job, but a caller cannot be relied on to have set the runtime up, so the action sets up what it
runs itself. Its findings go into the same lists as a workflow's, and an exception for one goes in the same lists too.

A set-up step with its own `if:` may be skipped while a later command still runs on the runner's own interpreter
(Copilot on HCW-NetworkEyes_AddOn#100), so it covers a later step only when that step's `if:` makes the set-up's true:
the same condition, one of the terms the set-up's condition joins with a top-level `||`, or a condition that joins one
of those with a top-level `&&` and has no top-level `||` of its own (a step under `a && b` runs only when `a` holds, so
a set-up step under `a || c` has run; Copilot on HCW-HybridCloudWorks#1716; but `a && b || d` can run through `d`
alone, so it is not split; Copilot on HCW-NetworkEyes_App#393), or, when the set-up's condition has no top-level
`||`, a condition with no top-level `||` whose `&&` terms include every one of the set-up's (`a && b` covers
`c && a && b`; Copilot on HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App#117), an `&&` term of the set-up's that joins terms with `||`
counting as included when one of those terms is (`(a || b) && c` covers `a && c`, not `d && c`; Copilot on
HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App#118). Conditions are compared without a surrounding `${{ }}`, with runs of
spaces made one, and a term without one pair of parentheses around the whole of it. Equal text means equal value only
for values that stay fixed during a job (`matrix`, `github`, `inputs`, `needs`, `vars`, `secrets`); a term that reads
anything else (`env.*`, which a step can change through `$GITHUB_ENV`, `steps.*`, `job`, `runner`, `hashFiles()`) is
never matched by its text, so its step is reported (Copilot on HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#74). The one exception is
`steps.<id>` of a step that comes before the set-up step: its outputs, outcome and conclusion are fixed once it has
run (the `core-update.yml` jobs' `steps.refs.outputs.changed`). Prefer the fixed values in such conditions. A set-up
step with no `if:` covers every later step whose condition does not test the job's status. A job's own `if:` does
not matter here, because it decides whether every step of the job runs, alike.

The job's status is compared on its own. Without `always()`, `failure()`, `cancelled()` or `success()` in it, a step's
condition includes an unwritten `success()`, so a set-up step with no `if:` is skipped once an earlier step has
failed, while a later `if: always()`, `failure()` or `!cancelled()` step still runs (Copilot on
HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#72). So after each job status (success, a failure, a cancel) a later step may run after,
its set-up step must surely run, or depend on the same thing by the rule above, applied to the conditions with their
status-only `&&` terms taken out, but only from a condition with no top-level `||`: `failure() && a || b` is
`(failure() && a) || b`, so taking `failure()` out would change it (Copilot on HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#74).
`||`, `&&`, `!` and parentheses are followed: `always() && !cancelled()` runs after
success and failure, not after a cancel.

Each set-up step (a composite action's too, which must have `runs: steps:`) must also ask for the floor or newer
(Copilot on HCW-CloudCrawler_App#81): `python-version` or `python-version-file`, `node-version` or `node-version-file`,
read through `${{ env.X }}` (the step's, job's or workflow's `env:`), `${{ matrix.X }}` (every entry of the job's matrix
list) and the named file, read only when it is a `.python-version`, `.nvmrc` or `.node-version` file at a relative path
inside the checkout with no `..` and no symbolic link on the way. A version that names a line only (`26`, `26.x`,
`3.15`) stands for that line's newest release, so it passes when the line is at or above the floor's; an exact version
(`26.10.0`) must be at or above the floor itself; anything else (`26.11.0-rc.1`, `26.11.0.0`, `lts/*`) cannot be
compared. A value this test cannot work out fails it, naming the step, rather than passing unchecked. A set-up step kept
below the floor on purpose is listed, with its reason, in BELOW_FLOOR_ALLOWED.

This is a copy of the check. Its canonical twin is the Python copy in HCW-NetworkEyes_App
(tests/security/test_workflow_runtime_setup.py), which the other HCW Python repositories copy too; its JavaScript twin
is the website's scripts/workflow-runtime-setup.test.mjs in HCW-HybridCloudWorks. The command reading (`_shell_text`,
`runs_runtime`, the patterns above it) and the condition rules (`covers`) behave the same as both; only the lists
below, which name this repository's workflows, are this repository's own. Keep the logic the same in each copy and
change it in all of them together.

The workflows are read with a small line reader rather than a YAML library, because none is a dependency here. It
relies on the layout every workflow in this repository has (a `jobs:` key at the top level, a `steps:` list, block
`run: |` scripts, `with:` and `env:` written `{ ... }` or as indented `key: value` lines); a file it cannot read that
way fails the test rather than being skipped. A `steps:` written on one line (`steps: [{run: ...}]`) or a step written
as one (`- {run: ...}`) is such a file: the reader stops with an error rather than read the job as having no steps. A
value YAML reads its own way is read that way: null (`~`, `null`, nothing) is empty, a block scalar (`|`, `>-`,
`|2-`, `>-2`) is its text, a folded one (`run: >-`) folded as YAML folds it, and a heredoc's delimiter is its whole
word (`<<EOF-1`, `<<E"OF"`), its body ending only at a line that is exactly that word (after leading tabs for
`<<-`).
